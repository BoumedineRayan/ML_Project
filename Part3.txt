                                         Project Overview
We developed a machine learning model to cluster FIFA players based on their ability and cost, with the goal of identifying 
"hidden gems" - players who offer high value at a low cost. This project follows the unsupervised learning approach outlined 
in the ML project requirements.


Cluster Analysis

Cluster 0 (Red): Low Ability, Low Cost
Cluster 1 (Blue): Good Ability, Average Cost
Cluster 2 (Green): Top players not relevant
Cluster 3 (Yellow): High Ability, Low Cost

The three profile and the Analysis

Zidane : 
AbilityScore: 70.0
CostScore: €163,000
Cluster: Yellow
Analysis : Zidane was created to be a hidden 
gem with decent ability but very low cost, making him an attractive target for clubs looking for value.

Kimmich : 
AbilityScore: 89.5
CostScore: €45,110,000
Cluster: Green
Analysis : Kimmich represents the elite category with world-class 
ability but very high cost, making him unattainable for most clubs.

Cherki :
AbilityScore: 81.0
CostScore: €0
Cluster: Blue
Analysis : Cherki is a free agent with high 
ability but zero cost, making him the ultimate hidden gem - 
a quality player available without any obligations .


Conclusion :
Our clustering model successfully identified distinct player groups based on their ability and cost characteristics.

The hidden gems identified in Cluster 3 represent opportunities for smart recruitment, 
where clubs can acquire quality players at a fraction of the cost of elite players in Cluster 1. 
This data-driven approach to player recruitment aligns with modern football analytics practices used 
by many successful clubs worldwide.


How We Built It:

Creating the Scores:
We made two simple scores to compare players:
- AbilityScore: We took the average of Overall and Potential stats. This shows how good a player is now and could be later.
- CostScore: We took the average of Value and Wage. This is basically how much a player costs overall.

These scores let us see who gives you the best bang for your buck.

Why K-Means with 4 Clusters:
We picked K-Means because it works well with number data. We tested different numbers of clusters
using the Elbow Method and found that 4 clusters made the most sense. Before running the algorithm,
we scaled the data so that huge cost numbers (like millions) wouldn't mess up the smaller ability
numbers (which go from 0-100).

Finding Hidden Gems:
We set some rules to find hidden gems:
- AbilityScore has to be in the top 40% (decent players)
- CostScore has to be in the bottom 60% (cheap)

This gave us 20+ good players who don't cost much. A lot of them are actually free agents that
most people aren't looking at.

Why This Matters:
Clubs can use this to find cheap talent they might miss otherwise. It's especially useful for
smaller clubs that can't afford superstars but still want to compete.
