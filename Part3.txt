                                         Project Overview
We developed a machine learning model to cluster FIFA players based on their ability and cost, with the goal of identifying 
"hidden gems" - players who offer high value at a low cost. This project follows the unsupervised learning approach outlined 
in the ML project requirements.


Cluster Analysis

Cluster 0 (Red): Low Ability, Low Cost
Cluster 1 (Blue): High Ability, High 
Cluster 2 (Green): Average Ability, Average Cost
Cluster 3 (Yellow): High Ability, Low Cost

The three profile and the Analysis

Zidane : 
AbilityScore: 70.0
CostScore: €163,000
Cluster: 3
Analysis : Zidane was created to be a hidden 
gem with decent ability but very low cost, making him an attractive target for clubs looking for value.

Kimmich : 
AbilityScore: 89.5
CostScore: €45,110,000
Cluster: 1
Analysis : Kimmich represents the elite category with world-class 
ability but very high cost, making him unattainable for most clubs.

Cherki :
AbilityScore: 81.0
CostScore: €0
Cluster: 3
Analysis : Cherki is a free agent with high 
ability but zero cost, making him the ultimate hidden gem - 
a quality player available without any obligations .


Conclusion : 
Our clustering model successfully identified distinct player groups based on their ability and cost characteristics.

The hidden gems identified in Cluster 3 represent opportunities for smart recruitment, 
where clubs can acquire quality players at a fraction of the cost of elite players in Cluster 1. 
This data-driven approach to player recruitment aligns with modern football analytics practices used 
by many successful clubs worldwide.
